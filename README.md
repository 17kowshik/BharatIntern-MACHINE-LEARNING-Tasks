**Machine Learning Projects Repository**

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share three machine learning projects for house price prediction, wine quality prediction, and iris flowers classification. I obtained the datasets for these projects from Kaggle.

**Project 1: House Price Prediction**

Overview
In this project, I have created a machine learning model to predict house prices using linear regression. The Jupyter notebook code includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Relevant Plots
3. Encoding Categorical Columns to Numerical Values and MinMax Scaling all Numerical Values
4. Train-Test Splitting
5. Model Creation (Linear Regression)
6. Evaluation Metrics Calculation
7. Predicting on New Data

You can find the code in the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` file.

**Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction**

Overview
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using linear regression and random forest. The Jupyter notebook code includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Relevant Plots
3. Oversampling the data to balance all qualities of wine
4. Train-Test Splitting
5. Model Creation (Linear Regression and Random Forest)
6. Evaluation Metrics Calculation for Both Algorithms
7. Predicting on New Data using Random Forest

You can find the code in the `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb` file.

**Project 3: Iris Flowers Classification**

Overview
In this project, I have built a model to predict the different species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals using logistic regression. The Jupyter notebook code includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Relevant Plots
3. Encoding Categorical Columns to Numerical Values (Species Column)
4. Train-Test Splitting
5. Model Creation (Logistic Regression)
6. Evaluation Metrics Calculation
7. Predicting on New Data

You can find the code in the `Iris_Flowers_Classification.ipynb` file.

Datasets
I obtained the datasets for these projects from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The datasets used in these projects are available on Kaggle.

Feel free to explore each project and the associated Jupyter notebooks to understand the details of the data, the code, and the results. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Enjoy exploring the world of machine learning!

Happy coding!
